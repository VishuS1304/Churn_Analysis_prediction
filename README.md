# Customer Churn Prediction

![Customer Churn Prediction](customer_churn.jpg)

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction repository! This project is dedicated to building a machine learning model that can predict customer churn for businesses. Customer churn, or attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a product or service provided by a company. Predicting churn can be invaluable for businesses aiming to retain their customers and enhance their services.

## Introduction

Customer retention is a critical aspect of business success. This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at creating a predictive model for customer churn. By analyzing historical customer data, we aim to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer attrition. This enables businesses to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## Data

The foundation of our predictive model is a comprehensive dataset containing customer information and behavior. This dataset encompasses features such as customer demographics, purchase history, engagement metrics, and customer service interactions. By processing and analyzing this data, we can uncover insights that drive our churn prediction model.

## Methodology

Our approach to customer churn prediction involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features such as customer tenure, average spending, and interaction frequency.

3. **Model Selection**: Exploring a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

4. **Training and Validation**: Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, training the chosen models, and fine-tuning hyperparameters.

5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.

6. **Prediction**: Employing the trained model to predict customer churn based on new data.

## Usage

To use our customer churn prediction model:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd customer-churn-prediction`
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Prepare your input data or utilize sample data provided in the repository.
5. Run the prediction script: `python predict_churn.py`

Remember to customize the script and model parameters to suit your specific use case.

## Results

We consistently evaluate and refine our model to enhance its predictive accuracy. The performance metrics of the latest model iteration are documented in the `results.md` file. We are committed to transparently sharing insights into the model's strengths and areas for improvement.
